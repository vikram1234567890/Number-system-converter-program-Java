**Usage**

1.Add your binary,decimal,octal or hexadecimal string in String variable named as 's' in file NumSystemConverter.java

e.g s=1001010

2.You will have to pass index where 

_index 1=conversion from binary to decimal,octal and hexadecimal_

_2 = from decimal to binary,octal and hexadecimal_

_3 = from octal to decimal,binary and hexadecimal_

_4 = from hexadecimal to decimal,octal and binary_

3.Output function is available in NumSysCalculation.java

4.This program also performs arithmetic operations such as +,-,*,/

-To do this you will have to convert the given number string to decimal by   

NumSysCon n=new NumsysCon();

n.todec(string_number,from_base);

then use Parse.java file from  another repository 'Calculator program java" send this decimal number string to Parse.java and then 
convert to the base of your choice.
